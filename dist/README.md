# Fanpage for CONSUMED, an album by the garages (the band)
Just a little something I did for fun to practice coding and web design.

This website is designed in such a way that the HTML should be able to stand on its own; all styling and such should be put entirely within CSS and JS, a bit like the philosophy for [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). I use Sass to facilitate writing the CSS while the JS is entirely vanilla, with a little help from Rollup and its plugins. 

I'm planning on writing a beginner-friendly blog to explain my process of making this!

Key visual and lyrics in the page are by The Garages, a wonderful band which I'm entirely unaffiliated with aside from being a fan. Go check them out if you haven't already!
