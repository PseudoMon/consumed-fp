          Oh some say I was, a major threat with claws
          They called my fire eater
          I used to be a shining symbol of bravery
          But now he’s just not here
           
          The crowd is shouting calling, that’s our cat boy Malik Destiny
          But I just can’t quite remember if that name fits me
           
          Then that roaring tide came crashing down on us
          A violent weather leaving all our memories damaged
           
          SCATTERED, my molecules were warped now I’m not quite the same
          Factured, pieces lost to the elsewhere now I can’t remember my face or name
           
          Little bits and pieces of teammates I once knew will flicker though
          But Patterson looks at me like I should feel more than I do
           
          But what haunts me most, I feel like this body isn’t mine 
          but try to see myself somewhere in it
           
          Staring at the photos of who I was 
          I disassociate and fear my mind I just can’t trust
           
          SCATTERED, my molecules were warped now I’m not quite the same
          Factured, pieces lost to the elsewhere now I can’t remember my name
          SCATTERED, my molecules were warped now I’m not quite the same
          Factured, pieces lost to the elsewhere now I can’t remember my face or name
           
          But I’ll just keep searching, I know somehow I’m here
          But I’ll just keep searching, seeking finding the memories I hold dear
           
          You may be gone, but you can always remake yourself
          Before long, you’ll come to love you’re someone else
          You may be gone, but you can always remake yourself
          Before long, you’ll come to love you’re someone else
           
          SCATTERED, my molecules were warped now I’m not quite the same
          Factured, pieces lost to the elsewhere now I can’t remember my name
          SCATTERED, I might never be the hero that they cheered for yesterday
          Factured, but I’m coming to terms with finding my new face and name

          So take a pound of flesh,
          If you think it would help.
          I can promise you this:
          nothing else will.
          Yeah, you sharpen your teeth, 
          Come on and take a bite.
          I can promise you this:
          I will survive.
           
          I’m back from the dead, or as close as I can get.
          It feels like there’s a thousand voices screaming in my head.
          I just have to move, cos I don’t want to forget:
          The tide's high, the water's rising, but I ain’t drowning yet (no, I ain’t drowning). 
           
          So take a pound of flesh,
          If you think it would help.
          I can promise you this:
          nothing else will.
          Yeah, you sharpen your teeth, 
          Come on and take a bite.
          I can promise you this:
          I will survive.
           
          This the start of the action, 
          and I'm main attraction.
          But I won’t give you the satisfaction of eating me alive.
          See you think we’re defenceless,
          but I know my soul is endless,
          and you can’t destroy what is Undefined.
           
          I’m Undefined, I’m Undefined.
           
          So take a pound of flesh,
          If you think it would help.
          I can promise you this:
          nothing else will.
          Yeah, you sharpen your teeth, 
          Come on and take a bite.
          I can promise you this:
          I will survive.
           
          I might be more, I might be less,
          But you’ll never make me a consumerist.
          I might be more, I might be less,
          But you’ll never make me a consumerist.

          blessings aren't what they seem
          just like every time before
          you could party with a losing team
          but I bet you're wanting more and more and more
           
          does it bring you joy to min-max?
          learn the excel syntax?
          i think you lost yourself in all those spreadsheets
           
          from each as we are able
          no guillotines at the table
          though we may eat you every week
          the 99 just want to speak
           
          the more you have, the less it's worth
          win or lose, it's all the same
          you get richer and you just feel worse
          this isn't how to play the game
           
          aren't you sick of trying to control
          an endless string of dice rolls?
          don’t let the coin decide the way that you feel
           
          from each as we are able
          no guillotines at the table
          though we may eat you every week
          the 99 just want to speak
          cause if we sow the seed
          we can harvest all we need
          but we could feed everyone today
          from your all-i-can-eat buffet
           
          and I know you've got a good heart
          it's not too late to restart
          and find the passion that you can't remember
           
          from each as we are able
          no guillotines at the table
          though we may eat you every week
          the 99 just want to speak
          cause if we sow the seed

          Waiting on the rising sun
          To lay its swollen eyes on me
          Not a second oh too late
          The heavy feeling fought to plate
           
          And I am here and you are far
          But we make burdens easy work
           
          Darling, you’re my second sun
          Shining on when I lose sight
          Take my hand when I forget
          That there’s a reason I’m alive
           
          And I have sown a field for you
          And I will reap what comes of it
           
          Waiting on the awling sky
          Punctured, let the light on through
          And spring returns as promised, you
          Start to believe in getting by
           
          It’s midnight in the parking lot
          I’ve never shone more brightly than
          In stadium with several suns
          Moonlighting once the day is done
           
          Darling, you’re my second sun
          Shining on when I lose sight
          Take my hand when I forget
          That there’s a reason I’m alive
           
          And we have sown a field for you
          And you will reap what comes of it
           
          I will not take my eyes off you
          When I think I’m not coming back
          It comes on when the music hits
          It comes on when I try to laugh
           
          You beckon and I’d steal for you
          It’s how I know that I’m still here
          It’s how I know love is a choice
          I make so I don’t disappear
           
          Darling, you’re my second sun
          Watching me where I belong
          Keep the lights from going out
          Keep the dark from coming on
           
          Darling, you’re my second sun
          Shining on when I lose sight
          Take my hand when I forget
          That there’s a reason I’m alive
           
          And we have sown a field for you
          And we will reap what comes of it

          I wake up on a rock hard bed
          Sweep the dreams out from in my head 
          And hold her in my mind 
           
          I’m running late, need to see my team
          Another zombie, not the first they’ve seen
          This place seems to attract my kind 
           
          I get my head in
          They see my problem 
          That she’s all that I’ve got left
          And now I’m oh so lonely
          But see the nights are holy 
          Cause I can pretend that she’s lying on my chest 
           
          I’ve got the best life, cause I'm living with the best wife, so I’ll keep on holding on
          Even if it hurts a bit, in the places that the sharks have hit, I’ll keep her as number one
           
          Everyone I knew moved right along
          In the twenty years that I’ve been gone 
          It’s not their fault, I know 
           
          She’s all that’s left in this crazy world
          She’s been through shit that no one’s ever heard
          A good life is what she’s owed
           
          It’s messed up I know
          It’s all I’ve got though
          So I’ll just keep giving my best
          Because I’m oh so lonely
          But see the nights are holy 
          Cause I can pretend that she’s lying on my chest 
           
          I’ve got the best life, cause I'm living with the best wife, so I’ll keep on holding on
          Even if it hurts a bit, in the places that the sharks have hit, I’ll keep her as number one

          A fire is burning somewhere 
          That I thought went out long ago
          It’s not fucking fair
          But now’s my time to go 

          I can see the sun going out
          I think we both know what that means
          It’s fine my love, I’ll be alright 
          Just know you gave me the best life
          You’ve been the best wife

          She lost her voice
          Under the ocean waves
          Smothered by the tides
          Drowned in the pouring rain
           
          But now she sees the truth
          Beneath the water lies
          A path to guide her home
          Elsewhere but still alive
           
          No more denial
          It's time
          She looks up and shouts
          To the empty skies
           
          "You cursed my name
          You swept me away
          But now I'm back
          And now you'll pay"
           
          Shattered chains
          Lie beneath the waves
          A solemn reminder
          Of where she once laid
           
          Lost in the elsewhere
          But lost nowhere at all
           
          No more pain
          No more illusion
          She looks up and shouts
          To the hollow skies
           
          "You cursed my name
          You swept me away
          But now I'm back
          And now you'll pay"
           
          So many years
          Wasted and gone
          Living with the weight of the sea
          In her weary arms
           
          Lost in the elsewhere
          But lost nowhere at all
          It's time to come home
          It's time to say goodbye
           
          No more tears
          No more denial
          She looks up and screams
          To the burning skies
           
          "You cursed my name
          You swept me away
          But now I'm back

          Where we’ve been living for so long
           
          And I don’t see you coming back
          For a long, long time

          Go back to the field where you’ll be met
          Thousands of fans, and their debt
          I’ll be in the crowd, cheering you on
          But I still want you home, not too far gone
           
          Cuz I don’t see you coming back

          And what will become of me then, will I be all alone again
